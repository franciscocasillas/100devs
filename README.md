100Devs is a bootcamp where I am learning Fullstack Software Engineering along with 2,000+ more people from around the world. Our teacher is <a href="https://twitter.com/leonnoel">Leon Noel</a> and the learning sessions are three hours long happening every Tuesday and Thursday live on his <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon">Twitch</a> channel at 6:30pm ET. We also have review classes on Sundays!

## How It's Made

This repository has all the exercises designed by Leon for class along with my own answers to them. There's a ton of repositories with exercises for **HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs**. 

Some of the exercises include creating a Tic Tac Toe game, a calculator and some other basic training exercises part of a developer's initiation process.

As part of the bootcamp we have to practice our coding abilities by solving at least one CodeWars  challenge every day. I've created a Codewars Repisotry to share my solutions which you can check <a href="https://github.com/franciscocasillas/codewars">here</a>.

  <br>

And I've used some of those problem's solutions to build some mini-apps that can be found <a href="https://github.com/franciscocasillas/mini-apps">here</a>.

## Lessons Learned: 
1. As part of the bootcamp, Leon taught us a lot of stuff, but one of the most important things was to learn how to learn. Leon introduced us to spaced repetition as a method to gain long term memory of the things we ever study and introduced us to Anki. Spaced repetition, interleaving and variation are three learning techniques that have changed my life for the better and couldn't be more thankful for. My long term memory has improved significantly and at times feels like a super power. Memorization actually does make a huge difference when coding and learning how to learn is a huge advantage in tech, where one has to constantly keep learning new stuff.
