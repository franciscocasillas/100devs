## How It's Made

This repository has all the exercises designed by Leon for class along with my own answers to them. There's a ton of repositories with exercises for **HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs**. 

Some of the exercises include creating a Tic Tac Toe game, a calculator and some other basic training exercises part of a developer's initiation process.

As part of the bootcamp we have to practice our coding abilities by solving <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/franciscocasillas">CodeWars</a> problems.

I've used some of those problem's solutions to build some mini-apps that be found <a href="https://github.com/franciscocasillas/mini-apps">here</a>.
