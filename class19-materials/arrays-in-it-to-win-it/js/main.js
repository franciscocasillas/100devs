//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["E.T.", "IT", "Titanic"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const oneMovie = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const arrLength = movies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const lastMovie = movies[movies.length - 1];
